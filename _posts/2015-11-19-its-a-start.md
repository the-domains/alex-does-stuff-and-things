Oh, hello, there. My name's Alex and you've reached my site. I'm still exploring the capabilities of [The Grid][0], so this is very much a work in progress. 

A bit about me: I'm a gamer, a tech enthusiast, a photographer and (occasionally) a newsman. I also enjoy road trips. With any luck, this will give you a preview of what you'll find here. 

So... welcome to my blog/portfolio/whatever this is. Let's get started, shall we? (P.S. You can find a full gallery of my photos like this if you [click here][1])
