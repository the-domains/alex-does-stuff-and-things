Welcome to my little slice of the web. My name is Alex Cole. 

A bit about me: I'm a gamer, a tech enthusiast, a photographer and (occasionally) a newsman. I also enjoy craft beer and road trips. With any luck, this will give you a preview of what you'll find here. 

Right now, The Grid (The "smart CMS" I'm using to curate this page) is still in Beta, so a lot of these posts will change from time to time as I tweak my settings, edit the content to see how it changes, or as The Grid itself is updated by the developers.

So... welcome to my blog/portfolio/whatever this is. Let's get started, shall we? (P.S. You can find a full gallery of my photos like this if you [click here][0])
