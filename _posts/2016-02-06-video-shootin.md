So today I actually did some shooting for a promotional video I helped write and edit for my friend's latest game prototype. This was interesting, since it was the first time ever that I have shot video. I have a raw blooper clip of me forgetting a line that I'd like to upload here, but [I'll settle for linking to it (click here)][0] instead. As for Grid matters, more UI updates. The "add media" button in drafts is now an icon of a landscape (photo frame, mountains). No other concrete updates that I can see. I tweaked my design guidelines again, and plan to publish them when I publish this post. I'll probably edit this text again if I wind up not liking it and reverting to my previous setup. 'Til next time, folks!
