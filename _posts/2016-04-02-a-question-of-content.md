![Birds on a feeder](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/8eee1c6e-ee5d-42c4-87c7-fadf838ee6d3.jpg)

I'm debating with myself whether to continue using this space as a mini-blog, or convert it into a straight-up portfolio.

If I keep it as a blog, the posts will remain very much the same. A blurb about whatever I feel like mentioning that day (the day's events, updates to The Grid UI, plus a random photo of mine). 

If I make it a portfolio, most of the text will go away, except maybe the particulars of the image I showcase (F-stop, Shutter speed, etc.).

If you're reading this, and have an opinion, [pop by my Facebook and leave me a message][0], or [Tweet at me (@Al3xCole)][1] with your thoughts.

Today's image comes from my backyard. Nice to have a feeder right next to a window, though I question what my neighbors think seeing me lurking at my window with a camera and no other context.
