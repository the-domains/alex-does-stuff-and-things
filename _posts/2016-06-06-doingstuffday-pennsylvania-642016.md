Well, this \#DoingStuffDay was entirely unplanned, but it was an interesting one. It started at the Steel Stacks in Bethlehem, PA.

The "stacks" for which the campus are named are a series of five blast furnaces formerly used for making iron. They're quite impressive, and one can only imagine the noise and heat that he or she would experience being as close as I was, were they active today.

The campus also houses a public access TV station, several event spaces and a freight rail line. When we were there, a dock jumping competition was going on, along with stands for various area nature organizations.

Unfortunately, after the Stacks, I didn't think to do much camera work, so I won't go into it at length. But I'll list off some of the locations: The Wooden Match (cigar bar and restaurant in an old train station), Roadside America (a railroad and miniature model display), a Pennsylvania Dutch store, Cabela's Hamburg location, Cigars International Hamburg location and back home.  
(P.S. Happy birthday, Dad!)
