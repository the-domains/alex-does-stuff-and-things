I did some shooting for a promotional video for my friend's latest game prototype. This was interesting, since it was the first time ever that I have shot video.

I helped write and edit the script, so I'm pretty happy with it, even if it's rather simple. I have a raw blooper clip of me forgetting a line that I'd like to upload here, but [I'll settle for linking to it (click here)][0] instead.
