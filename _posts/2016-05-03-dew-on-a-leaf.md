![Droplets of water rest on a leaf on the Watchung Reservation in New Jersey.](https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/c4da4649ab568e1e63d5e6c8780ed119639d66b4.jpg)

A friend invited me to go hang out at the Watchung Reservation in New Jersey. It wasn't quite a [\#DoingStuffDay][0], but it's close enough that I'm counting it.

You have ample opportunity to hike as far (or not) as you desire. There are many trails which meet up with or branch off of other trails. There's even a paved road, so you can skip the trails and get straight to the historic Deserted Village of Feltville (though, with two Private Residence signs that I saw, I'm not sure if it's truly deserted).

I particularly enjoyed the gorge back "behind" the village, which followed a small brook. There was also the old cemetery. Despite a sign indicating two dozen individuals were interred there, only a handful of grave markers were in evidence, dating back to the late 1700s/early 1800s.

There was a substantial amount of the reservation which I did not have the opportunity to see. On a second trip, I hope to check out a horse stable on the land, and explore the eastern side more thoroughly.
