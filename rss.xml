            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>It's an update!</h1><p>I haven't done one of these in a few days. Oh, well! Not so terrible a thing, anyway. In the interim, it looks like The Grid has instituted a "site design change review" page. </p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/ac5fa9dab97dd3bbd3a0c688becdb4f6b67ddbd5.jpg"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Still testin'</h1><p>I've determined that I'm not overly fond with how some Shares appear, but I think I still need to fine-tune my "Design" settings in The Grid's UI. Might be able to get something workable out of it. </p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/6156ca41e2ec71a140a68f477b30da007bf01ef6.jpg"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>It's a start...</h1><p>Oh, hello, there. My name's Alex and you've reached my site. I'm still exploring the capabilities of The Grid, so this is very much a work in progress. </p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/17950bcb87250b84639fed4437bd51e62029d801.jpg"></article>]]></description>

            <title><![CDATA[Shooting video!]]></title>
            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Shooting video!</h1><p>So today I actually did some shooting for a promotional video I helped write and edit for my friend's latest game prototype. This was interesting, since it was the first time ever that I have shot video. I have a raw blooper clip of me forgetting a line that I'd like to upload here, but I'll settle for linking to it (click here) instead. As for Grid matters, more UI updates. The "add media" button in drafts is now an icon of a landscape (photo frame, mountains). No other concrete updates that I can see. I tweaked my design guidelines again. Kind of like how it looks! My font choice (and Grid's font selection system) still needs work, though. 'Til next time, folks!</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/4b12c7409568aab19086743470805df120b7d13a.jpg"></article>]]></description>

            <title><![CDATA[Updates 'n' things!]]></title>
            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Updates 'n' things!</h1><p>Alright, take 2 on today's update post. The content guidelines are still the same, as are the options available for each of these posts while they are in draft form (minimal formatting/title/description options). I like how the guidelines allow you to review the changes before publishing them, but that particular UI is a bit garish (solid, bright yellow background). There is a new method for adding images, however. Besides the content-adding Plus sign on the left side of each new line break, there is a specific "Add Image" button that I will be testing with this update. That image will be a recent shot taken from Fort Lee Historic Park, across the Hudson River towards Manhattan. Part of a small shoot you can see in full by clicking here.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/205812e424dcdcc767ac186794d7a9a4150d18e9.jpg"></article>]]></description>

            <title><![CDATA[NYC Night Lights]]></title>
            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>NYC Night Lights</h1><p>After a lengthy absence, I return to see The Grid's made still more updates/upgrades to the UI. I like what I see. Unfortunately, I'm making this update very quickly while I remember to do so, in between other errands. I'll try to remember to make another post later tonight, which will take a closer look at the updates (and provide another image). This shot is from 5th Ave. in Manhattan. F/18, 20sec. exposure, ISO 100. Click here for the (very small) album.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/72e75ca3820228b8501222a1c22264e3f6cff30a.jpg"></article>]]></description>

            <title><![CDATA[YouTube Share Test - Fire Tornado from The Slow Mo Guys]]></title>
            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>YouTube Share Test - Fire Tornado from The Slow Mo Guys</h1><p>So it turns out that Grid does video shares by making the title clickable, not the image. I wonder if we'll get an Embed option in the future. Could be cool to actually be able to throw the video here so it's playable! </p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/f61e4f376c059abae10b22153ac9dc9d560611b4.jpg"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Day... four?</h1><p>I skipped a day. I had planned to try something new each day and make a mini-post here. Woops. That'll happen when Battlefront launches and you've been playing Fallout 4 way too much. </p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/3ad0852314b95b007a58ffaf052d222854cba7c7.gif"></article>]]></description>
