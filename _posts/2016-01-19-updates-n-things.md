Alright, take 2 on today's update post. The content guidelines are still the same, as are the options available for each of these posts while they are in draft form (minimal formatting/title/description options). I like how the guidelines allow you to review the changes before publishing them, but that particular UI is a bit garish (solid, bright yellow background). There is a new method for adding images, however. Besides the content-adding Plus sign on the left side of each new line break, there is a specific "Add Image" button that I will be testing with this update. That image will be a recent shot taken from Fort Lee Historic Park, across the Hudson River towards Manhattan. [Part of a small shoot you can see in full by clicking here.][0]
