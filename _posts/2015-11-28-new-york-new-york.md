Happy Thanksgiving, to those who celebrate such things! I celebrate "enjoy food with family day," myself. This Black Friday, we didn't shop. We just wanted Manhattan together. Saw the sights. Enjoyed the lights. I offer for your consideration my favorite photo from the shoot. I might edit this post in the upcoming week to include a link to the album.
