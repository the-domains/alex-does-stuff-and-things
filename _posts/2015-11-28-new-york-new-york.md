Happy Thanksgiving, to those who celebrate such things! I celebrate "enjoy food with family day," myself. 

This Black Friday, we didn't shop. We just wandered Manhattan together. Saw the sights. Enjoyed the lights. 

I offer for your consideration my favorite photo from the shoot. [Click here for the link to the album][0].
