My name is Alex. I'm a nerd (games and tech), a photographer and, occasionally, a newsman.

This (admittedly brief) blurb is serving as my "official unofficial" launch of "Alex Does Stuff (and Things)." Eventually, I hope this'll become equal parts blog, portfolio and place I can share fun things to do.

So... let's get this show on the road, shall we?
