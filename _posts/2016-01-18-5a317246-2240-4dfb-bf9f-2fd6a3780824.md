After a lengthy absence, I return to see The Grid's made still more updates/upgrades to the UI. I like what I see. Unfortunately, I'm making this update very quickly while I remember to do so, in between other errands. I'll try to remember to make another post later tonight, which will take a closer look at the updates (and provide another image). This shot is from 5th Ave. in Manhattan. F/18, 20sec. exposure, ISO 100\. [Click here for the (very small) album.][0]
