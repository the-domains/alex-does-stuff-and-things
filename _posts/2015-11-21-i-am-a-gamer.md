![Level 40 Warlock Voidwalker](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/fe2826f8-cc97-4ad1-af89-e8ab066e695e.png)

This test page has the eventual end-goal of becoming a blog on my nerdy endeavors. Ideally, I'd like to post mini-reviews and my thoughts on different games here at some point.

However, for now, all you get is this little post and a cool photo. The image is a screenshot I took on my Xbox One at the Court of Oryx in Destiny. My main character in the game is a high-level Warlock Voidwalker (think "antimatter magician with large guns"). 

My primary games right now: Star Wars: Battlefront, Fallout 4 and Halo 5\.

Games I'd like to return to at some point: Destiny, EVE Online

Games I'm looking forward to: Scalebound, Quantum Break
