When I first Published this post I had complained about how Shares appear. It's been a while, so I'm removing the critique until I can test them again.

Shares, in this CMS, are a function of the internet browser plugin. You right click the content on whatever site it may be and select "Share," and it is imported in embedded form onto your Grid site.
