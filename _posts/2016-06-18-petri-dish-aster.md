EDIT: If you'd like to skip straight to the video, [click here (https://youtu.be/Kh2H4hiAUV4)][0]. However, now that I've had some time to calm down, you can also read on for some context.

My friend [Zach Huff][1] likes to create games in his spare time. He's featured behind the word SCIENCE in the screen grab with this post. Some months ago, I helped him write and film a promo video for a new game of his, Petri Dish-Aster. We later recorded some voice-over bits, as well. One problem: Neither of us have video-edited before.

The footage and audio sat around for a while, ostensibly to give me time to self-teach editing. Luckily, we caught a break. [Deiana Skarda][2], a graphic designer with video editing know-how, put everything together, giving us our final product. We published the Petri Dish-Aster instructional video on YouTube under the banner of [Progressively Bad Productions][3].

We've discovered that we actually work pretty well together. Each of us specializes in one aspect of the creative process, but all of us have some knowledge of the whole shebang. It blends and fits together so well, that I think you can expect more from PBP in the future.
