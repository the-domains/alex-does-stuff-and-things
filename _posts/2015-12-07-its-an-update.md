I haven't done one of these in a few days. Oh, well! Not so terrible a thing, anyway. In the interim, it looks like The Grid has instituted a "site design change review" page. 

After I make alterations to what I call the "core guidelines" for my site, a page that looks almost like an itemized receipt shows up. It lists each design function, my selection and whether or not that change is "new." While this in itself doesn't make much difference in the overall experience other than being a nice little "final confirmation," that's not all they've done. 

It may just be me, but it seems like changes to the core guidelines have a more obvious change to the finalized site. Before, there were times where I'd make a change, and see no appreciable difference on the live page, even when my Chrome extension insisted the site was ready. It's nice to be able to say "oh, look! That aspect there is definitely conforming to my CG choices now!" 

Regarding this post's photo, Dec. 18 (Star Wars VII) can't arrive soon enough. Oh, my goodness, I'm excited. Unfortunately, no album link this time. I wasn't as fond of some of the photos from that shoot, so I shared on my personal Facebook profile instead of my professional portfolio page.
