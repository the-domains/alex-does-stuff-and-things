  On the 13th of July, I met up with a friend who wanted to do some photography.
  We spent entirely too long sitting at my house trying to decide where to go,
  but we eventually settled on Fort Lee Historic Park. Not going to lie; our
  deciding factor was its closeness to Edgewater and a favorite eatery of ours
  there.

On the 13th of July, I met up with a friend who wanted to do some photography. We spent entirely too long sitting at my house trying to decide where to go, but we eventually settled on Fort Lee Historic Park. Not going to lie; our deciding factor was its closeness to Edgewater and a favorite eatery of ours there.

Hey, look! It's a new post! I lazy'd out and just used a teaser from my Twitter page last time, but this time I've got something more substantial.

However, it was a cool opportunity, since the last time I'd visited, it was still winter and there was hardly any greenery in said park. That, plus an overcast day, led to some interesting lighting opportunities (or difficulties, in some cases).

Case in point is today's showcase image; the slightly-cool-toned close-up of a thorny plant's berries. Despite the photos I took from the day (which included some cool light-and-shadow angles on the former gun emplacements, and a looming angle of the GWB over the Hudson), this one seemed more striking.

You can find the rest of the day's Selects here, at [my Facebook photo page: http://bit.ly/29VoJj2][0]
